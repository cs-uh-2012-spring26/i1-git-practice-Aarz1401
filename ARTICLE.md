## Why I Found This Interesting

In the fast-paced world of software engineering, there is often a massive focus on **performance optimization** and **cutting-edge frameworks**. However, this article shifts the perspective toward the "human element" of engineering. It argues that since code is read far more often than it is written, our primary job as developers isn't just to talk to a machine, but to communicate effectively with the next developer who touches our work (which is often our future selves!).

What struck me most was the concept of **"The Principle of Least Astonishment."** The idea is that great software design should minimize the surprise a reader feels when looking at a piece of logic. In a world where AI is now helping us generate code at record speeds, the ability to curate and maintain *readable* logic is becoming a more valuable skill than ever before. It’s a great reminder that software development is as much a social and linguistic challenge as it is a technical one.

## Added Changes
Written by Arjun Iyer - As we continue to become software developers or programmers, we do need to have a better human element and that includes communication to our clients, machines, and our teams. We also are much better at adapation than majority of machines so we should keep in mind where issues have occured previously and change our methodology accordingly.
